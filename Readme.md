For this assignment, I want to create a website about bushfires, which includes some essential information and numbers for the reader to know more about bushfires.
 I want to create a simple website but also have some interesting interaction to provide information in different ways. 
 My website’s content can be divided into 3 that have three different ways of presenting. The first part is the definitions part to be put in a slide.
Although this is not a very new use on websites, it is very versatile and its javascript code is not very hard to understand. 
My second part is an interactive timeline, which can flip when the user pulls the mouse in a different box. 
The reason I chose this idea is because flip cards can increase the writing space in a small box and it also increases the user's surprise when seeing the number in it.
However, because the timeline only uses html and css, it does not show my javascript writing skills, which is one of the elements that this assignment needs.
The final part I only use normally paragraph writing code because I want to focus on the content instead of the interaction.
 However, because I find my site so simple, I added a half screen navigation that could be opened by the “content” button.
Besides the reason that it also uses a bit of javascript to increase the size, it can appear while scrolling the site, helping the user to change the context anytime they want.
Overall, I find my work still has not been used too much javascript and focus on the html and css more.
 Because my knowledge about this new kind of code is not very big, I did not know much javascript application to be used for websites. 
However, I think my website all include the essential needs of skills and also create interesting interaction for the users.
