      <div class="text">Bushfires are a result of climate change. Because of the heat of the earth and dryness of the environment, fire is easy to appear on some fire prone and combustible plants, especially some kind of Australian native plant. However, bushfires are sometimes also caused by humans. Some people, because of their lack of knowledge or personal benefits, burnt the forest to clear land or agriculture or trading purposes.

          <br><div class="sub"><p>To handle in bushfire</p></div>
          <div class="tips">
            <p><b>Keep an eye on conditions outside.</b> You may become aware of a fire before the emergency services.
            <br><b>Follow your plan.</b> If you don't have a bushfire survival plan ready, you should leave early. Always let family and friends know what you're doing.
            <br><b>Wear protective clothing.</b>Wear loose-fitting clothing made from natural fibres like wool, denim or heavy cotton and sturdy boots.
           <br><b>Stay informed.</b> Find out if there's a fire near you
           <br><b>Protect yourself first.</b> You can use protective clothes or a wet tissue to cover your nose and mouth.
          </p></div>
          
          <div class="sub">To prepare for bushfire</div>
          <div class="tips"><p>
            <b>Make a plan</b>Talk with your household about what you will do if there's a fire in your area, and make a written plan. You should make decisions like where you will go and what your trigger to leave will be.
            <br><b>Fire danger ratings</b> Know what each fire danger rating means and use them as your sign to stay or leave. Never wait and see. On days forecast for catastrophic or extreme fire danger, your safest option is to leave early, either the day before, or very early in the morning.
            <br><b>Know your 'Safer Place'</b> If you live in or intend to travel to a high-risk bushfire area, know the location of your nearest Neighbourhood Safer Place, meeting point or evacuation centre and how to get there. Neighbourhood Safer Places are places of last resort; they may save your life, but they do not guarantee safety. 
            <br><b>Prepare your survival kit </b> Be sure your bushfire survival kit is ready and you know where it is.

          <div class="sub">To take part in reducing bushfire</div>
          <div class="tips"> <p>
          <b>Clean the bushes in your area regularly.</b>Create empty space between shrubs and trees to reduce the chances of flames. Mop grassy areas and leaves regularly.
          <br><b>Do not use fireworks in the area near vegetation.</b>Use them in watery areas such as pools or rivers. Check your local ordinances to verify the restrictions and make the right move when using fireworks. 
          <br><b>Throw trash in the right place.</b>Because plastic and wood will make bushes even hotter, it can increase the percentage of fire and also pollute the environment.
          <br><b>Never leave a fire unattended. </b>If you finish camping, always put off the campfire and never it or if you finish smoking, always put off the fire before throwing it away.
